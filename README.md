## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Pre-Processor

### What I learned

When you work with cards it's quite useful to just use flexbox since this is easier setup and then go for the more complex desktop design with Grid. 

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to maybe focus a bit more on animations. But maybe that's for a later time? 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Everything regarding CSS.
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) - Helpful for finding errors in your code quickly.
